# Sensor-Network-Management-System
A city Sensor network Management system build using Data Structures

A sensor network consists of spatially dispersed and dedicated sensors for monitoring and recording physical conditions of environment like temperature, sound, humidity, wind, and so on for multiple stations (you can consider different areas in city).

The data from all sensors is collected at central location. Each sensor records the corresponding data at continuous time interval daily. Each sensor is represented by sensor ID (integer), sensor type, data it senses, time interval during which it senses the conditions continuously. The Neighbouring sensors communicate with each other and transfers data between them.

The network has systems of Air quality index (AQI) sensor which records entities like PM10, PM 2.5, NO2, SO2, carbon monoxide, ground level ozone etc. and tries to find out Air quality level and pollution level.
